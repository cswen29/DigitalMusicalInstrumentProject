# Digital Musical Instrument Project 2024

Have you ever wished you were able to generate electrical energy orbs with your hands? Hold fire in your palms or shoot magical energy from your own palms? 

Introducing the **PyroPalms** 

Now you can upgrade your cosplay through realtime sound and art! Follow along my journey of creating this experimental instrument! 


Here is my [Proposal](/Proposal/Proposal.md) and [Developer Manual](/Proposal/DeveloperManual.md). 
Once you get your hands on the PyroPalms, the [Getting Started Document](/Proposal/GettingStarted.md) and [USer Manual](/Proposal/UserManual.md) will be useful !
