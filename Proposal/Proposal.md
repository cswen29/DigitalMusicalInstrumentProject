## What will (likely) be the name of your instrument?
- PyroPalms

## In a paragraph or two, tell me about your instrument and how you intend to implement it.
- I would like to create two palm-sized balls for each hands that make noises based on your movements. The idea is it will be like [Raiden from Mortal Kombat](https://youtu.be/kzN-L6MErCg?si=9fUKzNOp7prXFxPg&t=42), generating electricity sounds, or those stunt magic performers on the beach, playing with fire on their hands  
- I would like this to be apart of someone's AR cosplay outfit, imagine a comicon where everyone has AR glasses and can see all these beautiful flowing orbs on each of your hands 

Hardware: Speaker, depth sensor, temperature(?) sensor within a ball. the ball most likely will be attached to a handglove or strap 

[Wow, I just found [something really similar](https://globalnews.ca/video/7785116/gesture-controlled-instruments-that-fit-in-the-palms-of-your-hands) done, but they did it as instruments, I want to focus more on generative sound design I think, elemental, magic fun ]

## Good outcome deliverable – Write a list of features of what you WILL achieve no matter what.
- Both balls play sounds based on gesture
- Gesture controls:
    - Volume 
    - Intensity 
- Two main sounds, fire and electricity 
    - For fire, when it's burning, you can blow it out 
    - For electricity, it requires both hands to generate sound, like how you would play an accordion

## Better outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you THINK you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.
- Wireless
- Balls recognize each other and also the space and height it is in relation to the ground... 

## Best outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you HOPE you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.
- When paired with a headset, audio will come through it and there will be an AR implementation of a magic orb or electricity charge etc... 
- Users able to charge up, by bringing their elbows backwards then pushing it forward like in [Avatar](https://youtu.be/PRkI15fIJ1w?si=wMkC4BpAYLPnHyW4&t=78) 
- Feet pair

## In a paragraph or two, outline your next steps and tell me what additional skills you will require and what topics you might research for the completion of this project.
- Actually synthesizing the electricity sound in Max, being able to adjust/automate parameters that will increase its intensity or volume etc, making it more complex, more energetic 
- I need to learn a lot of things TvT
